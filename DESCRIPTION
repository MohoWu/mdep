Description: Few (very basic!) functions on the data extraction and pre-processing of traffic counting data 
			of the Highways England MIDAS network. These function are used to prepare the road networks
			and traffic data sets for macroscopic traffic flow models (such as CTM/METANET).
			To use these functions you need to have access to the midas data base, which is available upon request.
			Raw data/transformed data are explained/provided in my PhD thesis.
